Kubernetes Scheduling
=====================
1.Filter suitable node.
2.Score feasible node.
3.Bind the node with the pod.

This is how kubernetes find the best node for the pod.

We can add labels to our nodes.

Instructing kubernetes Scheduler
================================
1.NodeSelector(label nodes)
2.Nodename(Bypass the scheduler)
3.Node affinity
   a)Node affinity
   b)Pod affinity

NodeAffinity:Required during scheduling and ignored during execution means,during scheduling the labels should be there in the node.Don't disturb the running pods if the labels are not there in the node.
