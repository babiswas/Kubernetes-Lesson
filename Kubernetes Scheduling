Kubernetes Scheduling
=====================
1.Filter suitable node.
2.Score feasible node.
3.Bind the node with the pod.

This is how kubernetes find the best node for the pod.

We can add labels to our nodes.

Instructing kubernetes Scheduler
================================
1.NodeSelector(label nodes)
2.Nodename(Bypass the scheduler)
3.Node affinity
   a)Node affinity
   b)Pod affinity
4)Prefrence
5)Pod affinity
6)Taints and tolerations.

NodeAffinity:Required during scheduling and ignored during execution means,during scheduling the labels should be there in the node.Don't disturb the running pods if the labels are not there in the node.
Node affinity is useful for labels having complex expression.
Pod affinity usecase when two services interact with each other frequently then they should be nearby.Pod affinity helps there.In short pod affinity helps in colocation.
