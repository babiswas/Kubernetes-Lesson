Kubernetes Scheduling
=====================
1.Filter suitable node.
2.Score feasible node.
3.Bind the node with the pod.

This is how kubernetes find the best node for the pod.

We can add labels to our nodes.

Instructing kubernetes Scheduler
================================
1.NodeSelector(label nodes)
2.Nodename(Bypass the scheduler)
3.Node affinity
   a)Node affinity
   b)Pod affinity
4)Prefrence
5)Pod affinity
6)Taints and tolerations.


Fine points
============
>NodeAffinity:Required during scheduling and ignored during execution means,during scheduling the labels should be there in the node.Don't disturb the running pods if the labels are not there in the node.
>Node affinity is useful for labels having complex expression.
>Pod affinity usecase when two services interact with each other frequently then they should be nearby.Pod affinity helps there.In short pod affinity helps in colocation.
>Taint is applied at the node.
>Toleration is applied at the pod.

Taints and tolerance
=====================
1.Noschedule(Schedule pods if they can tolerate the taint.Already running pods don't get effected.)
2.Prefer Noschedule(Schedule pods on the node if no othere node is avilable.)
3.No execute(Do not schedule pods if they can't tolerate.Also remove the pods which don't have the tolerance.)

Taint is applied at the node side and tolerance is applied on pod side.
