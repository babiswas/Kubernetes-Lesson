Kubernetes
==========

Service account
===============

1.Service account provides an identity to the pod to interact with kubernetes api.

a)Logical partitioning of a cluster is done by namespace.
b)A kubernetes namespace has multiple service account associated with it.
c)The service acccount provides identity to the pod so that it can interact with kubernetes api.

Why service accounts are required?
1.To authenticate pods against kubernetes api.
2.Fine grained access using RBAC
3.Attach secrets to pods so they call api server.


apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: my-service-account
  namespace: default


kubectl apply -f my-sva.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  serviceAccountName: my-service-account
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: my-image

Associating service account in pods.

Create a role say just for listing pods
Attach that role to a service account using "Rolebinding."


kubectl get serviceaccounts
kubectl describe serviceaccount my-service-account

A namespace has multiple service account associated with it.
namespace is seen as logical partitioning of kubernetes cluster.
Service account is namespaced resources.

Why multiple service account within namespace?
1.Provide least priviledge access to pod.
2.Enforce security boundaries within same namespace.
