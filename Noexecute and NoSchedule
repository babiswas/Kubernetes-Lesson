Noexecute and NoSchedule
========================

NoSchedule
==========
Impact on scheduling: This effect prevents new pods that do not have a matching toleration from being scheduled onto the tainted node.
Impact on running pods: It does not evict or affect pods that are already running on the node at the time the taint is applied, even if those pods do not have a matching toleration.
Use case: Typically used to dedicate nodes for specific workloads, like GPU nodes, where only pods requiring those resources should be scheduled.
