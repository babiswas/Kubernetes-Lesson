======================
Node shutdown can be graceful or not graceful.
Kubelet ensure pod follow the normal termination process during the node shut down.

shutdownGracePeriod 
shutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods 

When systemd gets notified of node shutdown kubelet sets non ready condition on the node.
Schedulers honor this condition and does not schedule any pods.

Kubelet terminates pods when node is about to shut down.

During a graceful shutdown, kubelet terminates pods in two phases:

Terminate regular pods running on the node.
Terminate critical pods running on the node.

1.Critical pods
2.NonCritical pods

pod priority based graceful shutdown.

=======================================================

Pod priority class name	 Pod priority class value
custom-class-a	         100000
custom-class-b	         10000
custom-class-c	         1000
regular/unset	         0

Taint is applied on the node and Tolerance we apply on the pod.
