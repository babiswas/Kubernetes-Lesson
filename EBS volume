Elastic Block Storage
======================
EBS volume is specific to availibility zone.
EC2 should be in the same availibility zone.
EBS-->Elastic block storage.
C drive in windows corresponding to root volume in linux.
Virtually attached device.
An ec2 instance can remain attached to multiple EBS instance.


An ebs volume can remain attached to multiple EC2 instance.
IO1 and IO2 ebs can be attached to multiple instances.

Instance store helps in providing storage inside the machine.
EBS is used for data persistance.Even if the machine is terminated but data loss doesn't happen.


SSD(GP2)
ls blk(list block)

How to use the ebs volume inside the system?
============================================
1.sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf(make the device available within the system.)
2.mount /dev/xvdf /test(mount the device for use)
3.mountpoint /test
4.umount /test
5.file -s /dev/xvdf(Check if the ebs volume has a file system attached.)

Detach EBS Volume
=================
1.Before attaching an existing ebs volume check if the filesystem is there in the ebs volume.
2.To check the file system execute file -s /dev/xvdf
3.If the file system is there than mount the device for use

mount /dev/xvdf /data

Resizing the EBS volume
========================
EBS volume can only be increased and cannot be decreased.
Increase the size of the ebs volume and check the disk free

df -h
resize2fs /dev/xvdf

There is a root volume in ec2 instance.

Increase the partition

growpart /dev/xvda 1
resize2fs /dev/xvda1
